 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
 My Prototype was going for a difficult game which is very frustrating to play. I wanted the gamplay experience to be tough, but it ended up having a mechanic where you can shoot multiple balls at once which makes it slightly easier because you can bounce the balls off of each other. It's pretty fun!
